1.What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
Ans:
SET search_path to pizza_runner;


WITH pizza_details AS (
  SELECT
    n.pizza_name,
    n.pizza_id,
    r.toppings
  FROM
    pizza_names n
    JOIN pizza_recipes r ON n.pizza_id = r.pizza_id
)

SELECT d.pizza_name, d.pizza_id, STRING_AGG(pt.topping_name, ', ') AS standard_ingredients
FROM pizza_details d
JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON pt.topping_id IN (SELECT UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(d.toppings, ', ')::INTEGER[]))
GROUP BY d.pizza_name, d.pizza_id
ORDER BY d.pizza_id;

2.What was the most commonly added extra?
ANS:
SET search_path to pizza_runner;
WITH toppings_cte AS (
SELECT
  pizza_id,
  REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(toppings, '[,\s]+')::INTEGER AS topping_id
FROM pizza_runner.pizza_recipes)

SELECT 
  pt.topping_name, 
  COUNT(t.topping_id) AS topping_count
FROM toppings_cte t
INNER JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt
  ON t.topping_id = pt.topping_id
GROUP BY t.topping_id, pt.topping_name
ORDER BY topping_count DESC;
